## 2. Mileage & Use Profile

- **Current Odometer Reading:** ~121,600 miles

### Use Characteristics

Based on service documentation, the vehicle appears to have been used for **personal, non‑commercial purposes**, including routine daily driving and seasonal four‑wheel‑drive use. There is no indication of fleet service, commercial towing, or sustained heavy off‑road abuse.

### Mileage Context

For a 2013 GX 460, mileage in the 120k range is considered **normal**. The 1UR‑FE V8 engine and associated driveline components are commonly documented to exceed **200,000 miles** when properly maintained.

## 4. Maintenance & Service History Assessment

### Overall Service Quality

**Assessment:** Above‑average

The vehicle has a well‑documented service history recorded through the Lexus dealer network, with entries spanning from pre‑delivery inspection in 2013 through 2024. Regular oil changes, scheduled mileage services, and multiple Lexus Quality Vehicle Inspections are documented.

### Notable Positive Maintenance Events
